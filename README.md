# CRUD_with_Database
Creating a REST API with Django and a PostgreSQL database for a customer management app. We shall set up a Django app with Django Rest Framework. 

Also, we will install PostgreSQL and connect it with our API. Besides, we shall perform CRUD operations (GET, POST, PUT and DELETE) on the API.

## What are CRUD operations?
CRUD refers to the four basic operations - Create, Read, Update and Delete - used in relational database systems.

CRUD enables the basic functionalities of creating, reading, updating, and deleting resources in a REST environment. The CRUD operations are usually mapped to standard HTTP methods - POST for creating, GET for reading, PUT for updating, and DELETE for deleting respectively.

From a database management perspective, the following explains how the CRUD operations work.

- CREATE: INSERT to create a new database record
- READ: SELECT to retrieve data from a database table
- UPDATE: UPDATES a record based on the specified primary key
- DELETE: DELETES a row in a database table
